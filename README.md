# Changing control and treatment groups matching to observe potential differences
## Abstract
In the paper, they used a minimum distance algorithm between census blocks and used as features the proportion of blocks with different caracteristics. We want first to see how their matching may have helped getting free of hidden covariates by making observations about the changes in cement floors proportion without doing any matching.
Second we want to test different distance measurments. In the paper, they used a Tchebychev distance. We want to see how different the matching may be with different measurments like for example the total or average of the distances.
Third we want to try out some matching with different features, like the average number of people per household.
## Research questions
1. Would the paper's results have changed if they did not do any matching?
2. Would the paper's results change with a different distance metric?
3. Would the paper's results change with a different set of features for the matching?
## Proposed dataset
We will use the same dataset as in the paper. We do have what they took to do the matching, so we will be able to do it differently, and we also do have different features at disposition for the third question.
